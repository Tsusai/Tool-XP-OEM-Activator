4=many other general uses.
5=
6=MagWMI which allows access and update of windows system 
7=information using Windows Management Instrumentation. MagWMI 
8=provides general view access to any WMI information using SQL like 
9=commands, and also a number of dedicated function relating to TCP/IP 
10=configuration, such as setting the adaptor IP addresses, and the 
11=computer name and domain/workgroup. There are also some examples 
12=for getting BIOS and disk drive information using WMI, and also a 
13=method using SMART for getting disk information since WMI has 
14=limitations on Windows 2000. SMART also returns disk failing or fault 
15=information. For disks that don't support SMART, SCSI Pass Through 
16=is used to get the drive serial number.
